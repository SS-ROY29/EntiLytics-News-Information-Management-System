Entity Analysis Module: Transformer-based Entity Ranking and Summarization

This module implements distance-based threshold filtering for both entity
importance ranking and extractive summarization, following the findings
from recent research on transformer semantic similarity.

References:
    "Transformer Models for Paraphrase Detection: A Comprehensive Semantic 
    Similarity Study" (2025). Evaluation on Microsoft Research Paraphrase 
    Corpus (MRPC) dataset.
    
    Key Finding: BERT-based models achieve superior performance using distance 
    metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean) compared to cosine similarity, with optimal 
    thresholds in the range of 0.45-0.60 for semantic matching tasks.

Rationale:
    Based on "Transformer Models for Paraphrase Detection" (2025), which 
    identified optimal thresholds of 0.45-0.60 for distance-based semantic 
    matching with BERT models on the MRPC dataset. The value 0.50 represents 
    the mid-point
Reference:
    Paper Section: "Results + Discussion" 
    Specific finding: "Mid-range thresholds (around 0.4-0.6) show better balance"
    Peak performance values: Euclidean ~0.458-0.568, Manhattan ~0.455-0.596
